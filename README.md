> StrongLoop Labs projects provide early access to advanced or experimental functionality.  In general, these projects may lack usability, completeness, documentation, and robustness, and may be outdated.
However, StrongLoop supports these projects: Paying customers can open issues using the StrongLoop customer support system (Zendesk), and community users can report bugs on GitHub.

The Android Java SDK provides simple API calls that enable your Android app to access a
[LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback) server application.  It enables you to interact with your 
models and data sources using a comfortable, first-class Java interface instead 
of using the clunky `AsyncHttpClient`, `JSONObject`, and similar interfaces.

See the official [LoopBack Android SDK documentation](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Android-SDK.html).
